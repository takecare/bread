### Technique

#### Autolyse

_TODO_

Something that I do differently than most people is adding the salt alongside
the flour and water - i.e. my autolyse process involves mixing the salt, flour
and water. I prefer to do it this way as the "traditional" way is more
complicated than it needs to be. Purists will say that this is not, in fact, an
autolyse and they may be right but you'll get the same results, with less work.

Adding the salt later is much more laborious and you need to make sure it is
properly incorporated into your already-formed dough, and that's not an easy
thing to do.

#### Adding starter

You should be fairly confident in your starter. That means you should've already
fed it at this point, with sufficient time in advance. Ideally it'll be bubbly
and "on the rise" - i.e. if it already rose to its peak and is now deflating,
it's not at the best point in time, but you can still use it. Alternatively feel
free to do the float test.

If you're letting your dough autolyse, you'll need to add the starter after this
process is done. I usually do this by hand, beginning with weighing and adding
the starter directly into the bowl where the dough is. I poke the dough several
times with the fingers of one of my hands, using the other to hold the bowl in
place. Poking the dough helps incorporate the starter, stretching and folding
the dough over and over after. Repeat the process until the dough is
homogeneous.

This is when bulk fermentation starts, so take note of the time now. At this
point you can let the dough rest for a bit if it's offering a lot of resistance,
before moving on to kneading.

Note: if you're doing an autolyse, most people would add in the salt at this
time as well. See [above](technique.md#Autolyse) for details.

##### Float test

If you want to check if your starter is ready to use the float test if a fairly
easy process to do so.

1. Fill 2/3 of a bowl/glass with water
1. Take a bit of your starter with a spoon
1. Place it in the bowl/glass
1. It should float, if it sinks to the bottom it's not in the best of shapes

If you're not too confident on your starter, do the test just before starting to
mix your flour and water. This way you can still mix those whilst the starter
feeds, effectively running the feeding and autolyse in parallel. Granted it's
not perfect, but it should help.
