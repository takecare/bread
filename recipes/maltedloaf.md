| Autolyse            | 1h       | ~23°     |

| Second fermentation | 2h       | 29-33°   |
| Total               | 6h       |          |

- Autolyse 1h at room temp
- Bulk fermentation in oven with light on
- Second fermentation in oven with light on
- Chilled in fridge whilst oven warmed up, after second fermentation
- Baked at max temp for 25min in dutch oven + 20min at ~200° dutch oven top removed
- Results: Expanded a bit to the sides (shaping wasn't good) but crumb was ok

- Over-fermented during bulk fermentation
- Dough considerably hard to work with
- Unable to shape appropriately
- Chilled in fridge whilst oven warmed up, after second fermentation
- Baked at max temp for 25min in dutch oven + 20min at ~200° dutch oven top removed
- Results: Shape turned out pretty bad as the dough expanded too much the sides
- Results: Crumb was good: good distribution in size and separation
