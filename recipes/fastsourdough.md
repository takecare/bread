- Autolyse ~1h30 at room temp
- Bulk fermentation in oven with light on (45min intervals)
- Second fermentation in fridge
- Results: hard-to-shape dough, resulting in poor shape
- Baked at max temp (~250°) for 15min in dutch oven + 25min at ~200° with dutch oven top removed
- Results: crum was ok, with uneven distribution of air pockets
- Results: loaf didn't hold its shape
